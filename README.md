# stocks_streamlite
This project allows users to visualize the historical stock prices of multiple stocks interactively in real-time using Streamlit and Plotly. By inputting a list of stock tickers (e.g., PETR4.SA, VALE3.SA, ITUB4.SA), the app fetches data from Yahoo Finance and displays an interactive line chart showing the stock prices over time.
